# ProGuide

Project Description – ProGuide

ProGuide is a smart product guide website designed to make online shopping simple and efficient.
Its main goal is to compare product prices across multiple e-commerce platforms so that users can easily find the best deals.

The platform is especially built with elderly users in mind, as they often face difficulties navigating through different shopping websites and manually checking prices.
ProGuide reduces this hassle by presenting a single, user-friendly interface where the best price can be quickly identified.
